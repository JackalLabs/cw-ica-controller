# Jackal Storage Outpost

The outpost wraps the controller functionality from the interchain accounts standard. This contract can port all of canine-chain's functionality over to any cosmos chain, so long as that chain supports cosmwasm.

A complete topology diagram is in the works.

A filetree msg has been successfully sent from wasmd to canined in the e2e environment.

A Complete road map to mainnet and Dapp integration documentation incoming soon.

The Jackal team thanks Serdar Turkmenafsar for developing the cw-ica-controller, and for his continued support in integrating it with canine-chain modules and jackal.js.

Special shout out to @Reecepbcups for his support during our initial testing of the cw-ica-controller on Junoâ€™s testnet.
