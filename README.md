# Jackal Storage Outpost

The outpost wraps the controller functionality from the interchain accounts standard. This contract can port all of canine-chain's functionality over to any cosmos chain, so long as that chain supports cosmwasm.

The outpost has been deployed on Archway's mainnet!

The Jackal team thanks Serdar Turkmenafsar for developing the cw-ica-controller, and for his continued support in integrating it with canine-chain modules and jackal.js. <3

Special shout out to @Reecepbcups for always being there for us since the outpost was tested on Juno's testnet way back in the bear market. <3
